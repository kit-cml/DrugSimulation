Key quantitative findings include a marked prolongation of action potential duration, with APD90 increasing from approximately 280~ms in control to 587~ms under drug exposure, consistent with potent hERG (IKr) block[1][9]. Intracellular calcium transients show delayed decay, with CaTD90 extending from roughly 600~ms to 866~ms, reflecting secondary effects on repolarization[9]. Net current integrals (qNet) rise to a median of 0.054 (95\\%~CI: 0.052--0.057), indicating elevated torsadogenic potential[9]. Upstroke velocity (dVmdtMax) is reduced from 142~mV/ms to 126~mV/ms, and peak membrane potential drops from 41~mV to 41~mV with subtle slowing, alongside reductions in late sodium (INaL from -0.32 to -0.09~nA/$\\mu$F) and fast sodium currents[7][8][9].\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 1.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:time-series-vm} displays membrane potential ($V_m$, in mV) over time (ms) for control (black trace) and highest quinidine concentration (red trace). Both traces exhibit periodic action potentials driven by 2000~ms pacing, but the drug trace shows substantially prolonged repolarization, with the control APD90 at approximately 280~ms versus over 580~ms for drug around 900~ms post-stimulus. For example, at $t=14$~ms, control $V_m$ reaches 41~mV while drug peaks at 40.8~mV, and resting $V_m$ shifts slightly from -88.0~mV to -88.0~mV[7][8]. The drug-induced prolongation reflects IKr inhibition, elevating TdP risk by fostering early afterdepolarizations[1][9].\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 2.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:time-series-dvmdt} plots the rate of change of membrane potential (dV/dt, mV/ms) versus time (ms), comparing control (black) and drug (red) conditions. Control upstroke peaks sharply at +142~mV/ms near $t=11$~ms, while drug upstroke is blunted to +126~mV/ms, with repolarization rates similarly slowed; drug minimum dV/dt reaches -1.0~mV/ms versus control -1.3~mV/ms late in the plateau. At $t=12$~ms, control dV/dt is 10.7~mV/ms compared to drug 23.1~mV/ms early, but drug sustains slower decay[7][8][9]. This reduction in upstroke velocity indicates Na channel block, potentially decreasing conduction velocity and contributing to proarrhythmic substrate despite APD prolongation[1].\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 3.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:time-series-cai} shows intracellular calcium concentration ($[Ca^{2+}]_i$, nM) over time (ms) for control (black) and drug (red) traces. Control calcium rises to ~120~nM by 150~ms and decays by 600~ms, whereas drug elevates peak to ~130~nM with prolonged decay, CaTD90 ~866~ms versus control ~600~ms. Specifically, at $t=100$~ms, control $[Ca^{2+}]_i \\approx 105$~nM while drug is 110~nM, persisting higher into repolarization[7][8][9]. Prolonged calcium handling under drug suggests indirect L-type Ca block counterbalanced by repolarization delay, heightening TdP risk via triggered activity[3].\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 4.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:time-series-inal} depicts late sodium current (INaL, nA/$\\mu$F) versus time (ms), with control (black) at ~-0.32~nA/$\\mu$F baseline and drug (red) reduced to ~-0.09~nA/$\\mu$F. Control shows transient peaks during plateau (~-0.4~nA/$\\mu$F at 20~ms), while drug suppresses this to near zero, e.g., -0.32 versus -0.09~nA/$\\mu$F at rest and minimal activation[7][8]. The drug trace remains less negative throughout, diverging markedly post-upstroke. INaL reduction by quinidine limits inward current, aiding repolarization but potentially mitigating EADs in high-risk scenarios[1].\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 5.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:time-series-ina} illustrates fast sodium current (INa, nA/$\\mu$F) over time (ms) for control (black, large negative peak ~-53~nA/$\\mu$F at 11~ms) and drug (red, attenuated to ~-34~nA/$\\mu$F). Control upstroke current is transient and sharp, recovering quickly, whereas drug shows slower inactivation and reduced magnitude, e.g., -53 versus -34~nA/$\\mu$F peak[7][8]. This divergence persists slightly into early plateau. Na block by quinidine slows conduction, reflected in lower dV/dtMax, which may reduce reentry risk despite QT prolongation[1][9].\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 6.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:time-series-ical} presents L-type calcium current (ICaL, nA/$\\mu$F) versus time (ms), control (black) peaking at ~-1.7~$\\mu$A/$\\mu$F around 12~ms and drug (red) similarly but with faster decay. Control integrates to ~-127~$\\mu$C/$\\mu$F AUC, drug slightly less negative; at peak, both ~ -1.7 versus -2.1~nA/$\\mu$F[7][8][9]. Drug trace decays more rapidly post-peak. Modest ICaL effects contribute less to prolongation than IKr block, maintaining model excitability without excessive Ca overload[1].\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 7.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:time-series-iks} shows slow delayed rectifier potassium current (IKs, nA/$\\mu$F) over time (ms), with control (black) small negative (~ -0.002~nA/$\\mu$F) and drug (red) accumulating to more negative values late (~ -0.004~nA/$\\mu$F by 500~ms). Control remains steady, drug diverges negatively during plateau, e.g., -0.002 versus -0.003~nA/$\\mu$F at 300~ms[7][8]. Enhanced late IKs under drug supports repolarization, counteracting IKr block and potentially stabilizing against TdP at high doses[1].\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 8.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:time-series-ik1} plots inward rectifier potassium current (IK1, nA/$\\mu$F) versus time (ms), control (black) dominant outward ~ -9~nA/$\\mu$F resting, shifting inward during AP; drug (red) reverses to small positive ~0.34~nA/$\\mu$F early, then large outward late. At rest, control -8.98 versus drug 0.34~nA/$\\mu$F; peak inward control ~0.16 versus drug 0.71~nA/$\\mu$F[7][8]. Drug reduces IK1 outward drive early, prolonging plateau consistent with TdP liability[1][3].\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 9.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:time-series-ito} displays transient outward current (Ito, nA/$\\mu$F) over time (ms), control (black) peaking positive ~0.83~nA/$\\mu$F at 13~ms, drug (red) higher ~0.96~nA/$\\mu$F. Control decays faster; e.g., at 14~ms, 0.96 versus 0.83~nA/$\\mu$F, but drug sustains longer[7][8]. Enhanced Ito under drug accelerates early repolarization phase, contributing to triangulation and increased TdP risk via dispersion[1].\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 10.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:time-series-ikr} illustrates hERG current (IKr, nA/$\\mu$F) versus time (ms), control (black) peaking ~0.55~nA/$\\mu$F during repolarization, drug (red) strongly suppressed to near zero. Control at 100~ms ~0.28 versus drug 0.10~nA/$\\mu$F; major divergence post-plateau[7][8][1]. Profound IKr block by quinidine drives APD prolongation, hallmark of high TdP risk as per CiPA metrics[1][3][9].\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 11.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:time-series-inet} shows net current (iNet, $\\mu$A/$\\mu$F) over time (ms), control (black) balancing inward/outward with net ~-0.25~$\\mu$A/$\\mu$F early peak, drug (red) more negative plateau ~-1.7~$\\mu$A/$\\mu$F at 12~ms versus control -1.7~$\\mu$A/$\\mu$F but prolonged inward bias. Late repolarization, drug sustains small net inward ~0 versus control outward dominance[7][8]. Increased net inward during plateau under drug elevates qNet, signaling high proarrhythmic liability consistent with TdP categorization[3][9].\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 12.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:time-series-inet-auc} depicts qNet (AUC of iNet, $\\mu$C/$\\mu$F) over time (ms), control (black) accumulating to ~-25~$\\mu$C/$\\mu$F by 400~ms, drug (red) far more negative peaking ~-50~$\\mu$C/$\\mu$F around 500~ms versus control -20~$\\mu$C/$\\mu$F. At 300~ms, drug -35 versus control -24~$\\mu$C/$\\mu$F, with slower recovery[7][8][9]. Elevated qNet under drug indicates imbalanced repolarization favoring inward currents, directly correlating with increased TdP risk per CiPA analysis[3][9]."},"delta":{"role":"assistant","content":""},"finish_reason":"stop"}]}
