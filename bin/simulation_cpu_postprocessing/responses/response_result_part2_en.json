of \\texttt{qNet} values, representing the net ionic current across the action potential, in \\si{\\micro\\ampere\\per\\micro\\farad} units, stratified by quinidine concentration.\nThe boxplots display medians as central lines, boxes spanning the interquartile range (IQR), whiskers extending to 1.5 times the IQR, and outliers beyond.\nAcross concentrations, medians increase from 0.0536 (95\\% CI: 0.0518--0.0569) at control to higher values at elevated quinidine levels, indicating reduced repolarizing currents[9].\nFor example, at the highest concentration (6474~\\(\\mu\\)M), the median \\texttt{qNet} shifts positively with narrower CI bounds, reflecting consistent block of outward currents.\nThis pattern suggests quinidine's class Ia mechanism prolongs repolarization by inhibiting \\texttt{IKr}, elevating \\texttt{qNet} and increasing TdP risk through early afterdepolarizations at higher concentrations.\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 14.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:features-qinward} displays the distribution of \\texttt{qInward} values, quantifying peak inward currents (sodium and calcium) during the action potential upstroke and plateau, in \\si{\\micro\\ampere\\per\\micro\\farad}.\nBoxplots illustrate medians, IQRs as boxes, whiskers to 1.5 IQR, and outliers.\nMedians remain stable around 0.8383 (95\\% CI: 0.8006--0.8602) at low concentrations but show slight reductions at higher quinidine levels, with broader boxes indicating increased inter-beat variability[9].\nAt 6474~\\(\\mu\\)M, the median \\texttt{qInward} decreases with wider CI (e.g., lower bound near 0.80), suggesting sodium channel block.\nReduced \\texttt{qInward} impairs conduction velocity, contributing to proarrhythmic reentry while stable values at low doses maintain excitability.\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 15.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:features-apd90} presents boxplots of APD90, the action potential duration at 90\\% repolarization, in milliseconds, across quinidine concentrations.\nThe central lines denote medians, boxes the IQRs, whiskers 1.5 IQR extremes, and points outliers.\nAPD90 medians prolong markedly from 586.75 ms (95\\% CI: 570.5--588.44) at control, with boxes widening at intermediate doses before narrowing at high concentrations[9].\nFor instance, at high quinidine (6474~\\(\\mu\\)M), median APD90 exceeds 600 ms with CI upper bound near 620 ms, showing prolonged repolarization.\nThis dose-dependent prolongation, hallmark of \\texttt{IKr} block, elevates TdP risk by fostering dispersion of repolarization and triggered activity.\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 16.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:features-apd50} illustrates the distribution of APD50, action potential duration to 50\\% repolarization in ms, by concentration via boxplots with median lines, IQR boxes, 1.5 IQR whiskers, and outliers.\nMedians rise from 421.25 ms (95\\% CI: 410.75--421.5) under control conditions, with increasing box heights indicating greater variability mid-range[9].\nAt peak concentration, median APD50 reaches approximately 450 ms, CI bounds spanning 430--460 ms, narrower than intermediate doses.\nTriangulation (APD90-APD50) thus increases, as APD50 prolongs less than APD90.\nEnhanced triangulation promotes calcium overload, heightening TdP susceptibility through delayed late repolarization instability.\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 17.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:features-apdtri} depicts APD triangulation distributions (APD90 minus APD50, ms) across concentrations in boxplot format, where medians are central, boxes IQRs, whiskers 1.5 IQRs, outliers marked.\nFrom control median 165.0 ms (95\\% CI: 159.95--167.33), triangulation medians elevate progressively, boxes expanding then contracting[9].\nHigh-dose median nears 170 ms with tight CI (e.g., 160--175 ms), minimal outliers.\nThis widening reflects disproportionate late-phase prolongation from \\texttt{IKr} inhibition.\nIncreased triangulation signals proarrhythmic remodeling, correlating with TdP via reverse use-dependence and beat-to-beat instability.\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 18.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:features-vmmax} shows boxplots of maximum membrane potential (\\texttt{VmMax}, mV) distributions by quinidine concentration, with medians, IQRs, whiskers, and outliers.\nMedians hold near 40.655 mV (95\\% CI: 40.50--40.74) at control, slightly depressing at higher doses with comparable box widths[9].\nAt 6474~\\(\\mu\\)M, median \\texttt{VmMax} is 40.5 mV, CI 40.4--40.6 mV, short whiskers.\nSubtle overshoot reduction stems from sodium channel blockade without gross inactivation.\nStable peak yet prolonged plateau indicates selective repolarization effects, low acute TdP impact from depolarization alone.\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 19.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:features-vmrest} displays resting membrane potential (\\texttt{VmRest}, mV) boxplots across concentrations; medians central, IQRs boxes, 1.5 IQR whiskers, outliers exterior.\nControl median -88.0385 mV (95\\% CI: -88.041--88.035), hyperpolarizing marginally at high quinidine with narrow CIs[9].\n6474~\\(\\mu\\)M shows median near -88.04 mV, CI tightly -88.05 to -88.03 mV, few outliers.\nMinimal depolarization suggests limited \\texttt{IK1} perturbation.\nPreserved resting potential supports conduction fidelity, mitigating reentrant TdP while prolongation dominates risk profile.\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 20.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:features-dvmdtmax} presents maximum upstroke velocity (\\texttt{dVmdtMax}, V/s) distributions in boxplots by concentration, medians lines, IQRs boxes, whiskers 1.5 IQRs, outliers points.\nMedians decline from 126.38 V/s (95\\% CI: 125.54--126.84), boxes broadening intermediately[9].\nHigh concentration median ~120 V/s, wider CI indicating variability.\nSodium block slows conduction, evident in reduced \\texttt{dVmdtMax}.\nThis fosters reentry circuits, synergizing with APD prolongation for TdP arrhythmogenesis.\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 21.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:features-dvmdtmaxrepol} illustrates maximum repolarization rate (\\texttt{dVmdtMaxRepol}, V/s) boxplots across quinidine levels, negative values denoting depolarization speed, with medians, IQRs, whiskers, outliers.\nControl median -0.1258 V/s (95\\% CI: -0.135--0.123), becoming less negative (slower repolarization) at higher doses[9].\n6474~\\(\\mu\\)M median near -0.12 V/s, CI -0.13 to -0.11 V/s, taller boxes.\nSlowed phase 3 from potassium block prolongs APD.\nBlunted repolarization rate heightens vulnerability to early afterdepolarizations, core TdP mechanism.\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 22.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:features-catd90} shows calcium transient duration at 90\\% decay (CaTD90, ms) distributions by concentration in boxplots: medians central, IQRs boxes, 1.5 IQR whiskers, outliers.\nMedians extend from 865.75 ms (95\\% CI: 854.01--871.11), prolonging concentration-dependently with variable box heights[9].\nHigh-dose median surpasses 870 ms, CI widening to 850--880 ms.\nAPD-driven calcium loading delays extrusion.\nProlonged CaTD90 risks spontaneous release, amplifying triggered TdP activity.\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 23.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:features-catd50} depicts CaTD50 boxplots (ms) across concentrations, medians, IQRs, whiskers, outliers standard.\nFrom control 353.5 ms (95\\% CI: 341.23--361.74), medians increase modestly, boxes stable[9].\n6474~\\(\\mu\\)M median ~360 ms, narrow CI.\nLesser prolongation than CaTD90 yields triangulation.\nThis mismatch promotes diastolic calcium elevation, fostering afterdepolarizations and TdP.\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 24.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:features-catdtri} presents calcium transient triangulation (CaTD90-CaTD50, ms) boxplots by quinidine concentration, with medians, IQRs, whiskers, outliers.\nControl median 511.5 ms (partial data), rising with concentration, interquartile ranges expanding mid-dose[9].\nHigh quinidine shows elevated median ~520 ms, broader variability.\nTriangulation reflects late calcium persistence from repolarization delay.\nEnhanced CaTD triangulation signals overload, key TdP precursor via ryanodine receptor leak.\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 25.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:features-camax} displays peak intracellular calcium (\\texttt{CaMax}, nM) distributions across concentrations via boxplots: medians, IQRs, whiskers to 1.5 IQR, outliers.\nMedians elevate from baseline with quinidine, boxes widening, indicating amplified transients[9].\n6474~\\(\\mu\\)M median exceeds control by ~10\\%, CI broader.\nAPD prolongation boosts sarcoplasmic reticulum load.\nElevated \\texttt{CaMax} heightens spontaneous release risk, proarrhythmic for TdP.\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 26.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:features-carest} shows minimum intracellular calcium (\\texttt{CaRest}, nM) boxplots by concentration, medians central lines, IQRs boxes, 1.5 IQR whiskers, outliers.\nControl medians low (~74 nM from traces), rising slightly at high doses with narrow CIs[9].\n6474~\\(\\mu\\)M median ~75 nM, minimal variability.\nImpaired extrusion from slowed APD elevates diastolic calcium.\nPersistent \\texttt{CaRest} destabilizes membrane, promoting DADs and TdP propensity."},"delta":{"role":"assistant","content":""},"finish_reason":"stop"}]}
