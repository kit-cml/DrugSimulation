In control conditions (Figure 1), the membrane potential exhibits a characteristic action potential with rapid upstroke, plateau phase, and repolarization, accompanied by robust inward sodium current during depolarization and balanced outward potassium currents during repolarization, alongside calcium handling that maintains transient duration within physiological ranges. At low drug concentrations, time-series traces show modest prolongation of the plateau phase, reflected in reduced peak magnitudes of late sodium current and L-type calcium current integrals, consistent with quinidine's multi-channel block on sodium channels, hERG-encoded IKr, and other potassium conductances. Higher concentrations (e.g., Figure 11 at 6474 concentration units) demonstrate marked prolongation of repolarization, with slowed phase 3 decay in membrane potential, diminished IKr as seen in reduced current traces, and disrupted calcium transient kinetics due to altered ICaL handling, leading to elevated diastolic calcium levels and prolonged transient durations. These dynamic changes across beats highlight reduced repolarization reserve, a hallmark of torsades de pointes (TdP) proarrhythmic liability, as quinidine inhibits key repolarizing currents while enhancing inward late sodium contributions, thereby increasing net charge imbalance.\n\nFeature-level summary statistics, derived from median values and 95\\% confidence intervals across multiple simulations (Figure 13), provide aggregated insights that reinforce and quantify the time-series trends while revealing population-level variability critical for TdP risk assessment in a CiPA-style in silico paradigm. The qNet metric, representing the median net charge transfer normalized by capacitance, shifts positively with increasing concentration, indicating reduced outward current dominance and heightened early afterdepolarization susceptibility, with confidence intervals widening at higher doses to suggest heterogeneous responses akin to patient variability. Similarly, qInward, the inward charge normalized by membrane area, increases alongside prolonged action potential duration at 90\\% repolarization (APD90 median around 587 milliseconds) and 50\\% repolarization (APD50 median 421 milliseconds), accompanied by elevated APD triangulation (median 165 milliseconds), all with overlapping yet broadened 95\\% confidence intervals that nuance single-beat observations by capturing stochastic ion channel behaviors. Calcium transient durations (CaTD90 median 866 milliseconds, CaTD50 354 milliseconds) and triangulation exhibit parallel prolongation, linking disrupted calcium handling to repolarization instability. These distributions across concentrations support mechanistic hypotheses of ion channel block eroding repolarization reserve, with high-concentration medians and intervals indicating high TdP risk through excessive APD prolongation and triangulation, consistent with quinidine's clinical proarrhythmic profile, while lower doses show low-risk profiles with tighter intervals, validating the framework's utility for concentration-dependent classification without discrepancies from expected CiPA paradigms."},"delta":{"role":"assistant","content":""},"finish_reason":"stop"}]}
