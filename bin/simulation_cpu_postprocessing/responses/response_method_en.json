The CiPA v1.0 endocardial (endo) variant of the O’Hara–Rudy dynamic model was employed to predict Torsade de Pointes (TdP) liability by quantifying key electrophysiological biomarkers from multi-channel ionic current inhibition data derived from drug concentration–response experiments[1][7][8]. Quinidine was tested at concentrations of 3237 nM and 6474 nM, with ion channel inhibition profiles specified by Hill equation parameters from IC50 data and hERG-specific bootstrap parameters[7][8]. Simulations used a cycle length of 2000 ms, stimulus duration of 0.5 ms, and stimulus amplitude scale of 1.0, solved via the CVode solver with time steps between 0.5 ms and 2.0 ms[7][8].\n\nA key quantitative endpoint was qNet, defined as the net electronic charge carried by the major ionic currents during one cardiac action potential, computed as the time integral of the net current iNet[1][7][8]. This is expressed as\n\\[\nq_{\\text{Net}} = \\int_{0}^{T} \\left( I_{\\text{Na}} + I_{\\text{CaL}} + I_{\\text{Kr}} + I_{\\text{Ks}} + I_{\\text{to}} + I_{\\text{K1}} \\right) \\, dt\n\\]\nwhere \\(T\\) is the duration of one cardiac cycle, and \\(I_{\\text{Na}}\\), \\(I_{\\text{CaL}}\\), \\(I_{\\text{Kr}}\\), \\(I_{\\text{Ks}}\\), \\(I_{\\text{to}}\\), and \\(I_{\\text{K1}}\\) represent the sodium, L-type calcium, rapid and slow delayed-rectifier potassium, transient outward potassium, and inward rectifier potassium currents, respectively[1]. Lower qNet values tend to associate with reduced repolarization reserve and higher proarrhythmic potential, as they indicate an imbalance favoring inward currents that prolong action potential duration[1].\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Steady-state action potentials were achieved by pacing at the specified cycle length until convergence.\n\\item Ionic currents and membrane voltage were simulated across multiple parameter samples (10 per channel set) to capture variability in inhibition profiles[7][8].\n\\item Biomarkers including APD90, qNet, and calcium transients were extracted from time-series data written at 1.0 ms intervals[7][8].\n\\item Parallel computation utilized 10 CPUs for efficient processing of initial value ensembles[7][8].\n\\end{itemize}\n\nAll simulations and qNet computations were performed using rigorously validated numerical solvers and verified parameter consistency under CiPA reference conditions[1][7][8].\n```"},"delta":{"role":"assistant","content":""},"finish_reason":"stop"}]}
