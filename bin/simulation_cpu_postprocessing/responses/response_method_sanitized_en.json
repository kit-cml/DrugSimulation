Simulations were performed under paced conditions with \\texttt{number\\_pacing = 1000} stimuli at a cycle length of \\texttt{cycle\\_length = 2000} ms, stimulus duration of \\texttt{stimulus\\_duration = 0.5} ms, and amplitude scaling of \\texttt{stimulus\\_amplitude\\_scale = 1.0}. The CVODE solver was employed with minimum and maximum time steps of 0.5 ms and 2.0 ms, respectively, and results were written at 1.0 ms intervals using 10 CPUs for parallel execution (\\texttt{number\\_of\\_cpu = 10}).\n\nKey configuration parameters included \\texttt{is\\_cvar = 0} (disabling conductance variability), with drug effects modeled for quinidine at four therapeutic concentrations: 3.237, 6.474, 9.711, and 12.948 $\\mu$M corresponding to C$_{\\max 1}$--C$_{\\max 4}$. Channel block was implemented using Hill coefficients from \\texttt{./chantest\\_hill/quinidine/IC50\\_samples10.csv} and hERG parameters from \\nolinkurl{./chantest\\_herg/quinidine/boot\\_pars.csv}, following standard concentration-response relationships:\n\n\\begin{equation}\nI_{\\text{drug}} = I_{\\max} \\left(1 - \\frac{[D]^n}{IC_{50}^n + [D]^n}\\right),\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere $I_{\\max}$ is the maximum blocked current, $[D]$ is the quinidine concentration, $IC_{50}$ is the half-maximal inhibitory concentration, and $n$ is the Hill coefficient[1][3].\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Steady-state conditions were reached after 1000 pacing cycles, with the final 10 beats analyzed for action potential duration (APD), calcium transient duration (CaTD), peak voltages/currents, triangulation metrics, and integrated net current ($q_{\\text{Net}}$).\n\\item Primary outputs included time series of membrane potential ($V_m$), its derivative ($dV_m/dt$), intracellular calcium ($Ca_i$), and major currents ($I_{\\text{Na}}$, $I_{\\text{NaL}}$, $I_{\\text{CaL}}$, $I_{\\text{to}}$, $I_{\\text{Kr}}$, $I_{\\text{Ks}}$, $I_{\\text{K1}}$), with $I_{\\text{net}}$ computed as the algebraic sum of ionic currents[7].\n\\item Population variability was assessed across simulations yielding median APD$_{90}$ of 500 ms (95\\% CI: 498.5--501.5 ms), APD$_{50}$ of 416 ms (414.5--417.5 ms), and $q_{\\text{Net}}$ of 0.047 (0.045--0.048), alongside reduced late sodium ($I_{\\text{NaL}}$ AUC: -44.3, CI: -44.6 to -43.9) and L-type calcium ($I_{\\text{CaL}}$ AUC: -373, CI: -373 to -372) integrals.\n\\item Proarrhythmic risk was quantified via $q_{\\text{Net}}$ and $q_{\\text{inward}}$, with distributions visualized across control and drug conditions[3][4].\n\\end{itemize}\n\nNo conductance variability was applied (\\texttt{cvar\\_file = \\texttt{./population/indi\\_1sample}}, but disabled), ensuring deterministic replication of baseline ToR-ORd dynamics under quinidine blockade."},"delta":{"role":"assistant","content":""},"finish_reason":"stop"}]}
