          "text": "You are a data analyst writing SCI-level LaTeX.\r\n\r\nIn THIS call, write ONLY the Result section up to Figure 12. Do NOT write Methods, Discussion, or any text about Figures 13\u201326. Additionally, please make sure to write Result section header at the beginning.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you are provided both control time-series data and highest concentration time-series data. Use those files and compare them to each other whenever possible.\r\n\r\nStructure:\r\n- First, write 2\u20133 introductory Result paragraphs summarizing quantitative findings from the CSVs, without mentioning any Figures.\r\n- Then write 12 comprehensive paragraphs, one for each of Figures 1\u201312, in order.\r\n\r\nFixed meanings:\r\n- Figure 1: membrane potential over time, with the LaTex label {fig:time-series-vm}.\r\n- Figure 2: rate of change of membrane potential over time, with the LaTex label {fig:time-series-dvmdt}.\r\n- Figure 3: intracellular calcium concentration over time, with the LaTex label {fig:time-series-cai}.\r\n- Figure 4: late sodium current over time, with the LaTex label {fig:time-series-inal}.\r\n- Figure 5: fast sodium current over time, with the LaTex label {fig:time-series-ina}.\r\n- Figure 6: L-type calcium current over time, with the LaTex label {fig:time-series-ical}.\r\n- Figure 7: slow delayed rectifier potassium current over time, with the LaTex label {fig:time-series-iks}.\r\n- Figure 8: inward rectifier potassium current over time, with the LaTex label {fig:time-series-ik1}.\r\n- Figure 9: transient outward current over time, with the LaTex label {fig:time-series-ito}.\r\n- Figure 10: hERG current over time, with the LaTex label {fig:time-series-ikr}.\r\n- Figure 11: net inward and outward current (iNet) over time, with the LaTex label {fig:time-series-inet}.\r\n- Figure 12: AUC of net inward and outward current (qNet) over time, with the LaTex label {fig:time-series-inet-auc}.\r\n\r\nFor each Figure paragraph (1\u201312):\r\n- Start with \\paragraph{Figure X.}\r\n- Refer to the LaTeX label (e.g., Figure~\\ref{fig:time-series-vm} and Figure~\\ref{fig:features-ca-max}).\r\n- Use at least 4\u20135 sentences.\r\n- Include: overall description, axes and units, at least one key trend, at least one concrete numeric example from the CSVs, and one interpretive sentence about TdP risk or model behavior.\r\n- Do not mention any other Figures in that paragraph.\r\n\r\nDo not group multiple figures in one paragraph and do not discuss Figures 13\u201326. Make sure the link to the figure ID is correct.\r\n\r\nSTRICT LATEX RULES (MUST OBEY):\r\n1. Math delimiters:\r\n   - Use \\( ... \\) for inline math, \\[ ... \\] for display math.\r\n   - Never write escaped math delimiters like `\\\\(` or `\\\\)`; always emit a single backslash: `\\(`, `\\)`.\r\n   - Every \\( must have a matching \\), every \\[ must have a matching \\]. Do not nest them.\r\n\r\n2. Underscores:\r\n   - No underscore should be allowed.\r\n   - For parameter or file names with underscores (e.g. is_cvar, chantest_hill), wrap them in \\texttt{...} in text mode: \\texttt{is_cvar}, \\texttt{chantest_hill\/IC50_samples10.csv}.\r\n\r\n3. Subscripts and superscripts:\r\n   - Please do not use any subscript. No underscore is allowed.\r\n\r\n4. Percent, tilde, minus:\r\n   - Percent sign in text must be written as `\\%`, not `%`.\r\n   - Non-breaking spaces: use `~` (ASCII tilde), never the Unicode tilde operator (U+223C). Do not paste `\u223C`.\r\n   - Minus signs in math should be ASCII `-` inside math mode, e.g. \\(-0.139\\). Do NOT use the Unicode minus `\u2212` (U+2212).\r\n\r\n5. Units:\r\n   - Use plain LaTeX or siunitx-style macros consistently.\r\n   - For micro (\u00B5), either:\r\n     * Use \\(\\mu\\) inside math, e.g. 12.948~\\(\\mu\\)M, or\r\n     * If siunitx is loaded in the document, use \\si{\\micro\\mole\\per\\litre} or \\SI{12.948}{\\micro\\mole\\per\\litre}.\r\n   - Do NOT invent macros like \\micro or \\molar; they will be undefined.\r\n\r\n6. Braces and parentheses:\r\n   - Make sure every `{` has a matching `}`.\r\n   - In patterns like `([Ca^{2+}]_{i})`, the closing parenthesis should be OUTSIDE the math if you open it in text, for example:\r\n     * `intracellular calcium (\\([Ca^{2+}]_{i}\\))`.\r\n\r\n7. No double escaping:\r\n   - Never write `\\\\%` for a percent; use `\\%` in text.\r\n   - Never write `\\\\mu` when you mean `\\mu`.\r\n   - Do not add extra backslashes in front of existing LaTeX commands.\r\n\r\n8. No new commands:\r\n   - Do not define new macros (no \\newcommand, \\def, etc.). Use only standard LaTeX and the commands mentioned in this prompt.\r\n\r\nFORMAT RESTRICTIONS (IMPORTANT):\r\n- Output must be valid LaTeX only.\r\n- Do NOT use Markdown formatting: no `*` or `**` for emphasis, no backtick code fences, no headings like `#`.\r\n- Terms like qNet, TdP risk, APD90, etc., must appear as plain text without surrounding asterisks. For example: write `qNet` not `**qNet**`, `TdP risk` not `**TdP risk**`.\r\n\r\nRESULT COMPARISON AND FIGURE-LABEL EXTENSION:\r\n- For every descriptive sentence that can be quantified, preferentially use paired values from both the control and the highest drug concentration time-series (for example, report control and drug peak values, times to peak, resting levels, or beat-to-beat variability side-by-side). Emphasize how the drug trace deviates from the corresponding control trace over time, rather than describing either in isolation.\r\n- When describing trends (e.g., prolongation, triangulation, alternans, amplitude reduction), anchor them with at least one concrete numeric example that explicitly contrasts control versus drug (for instance, a control action potential duration of 280~ms versus 340~ms under the highest dose).\r\n- For each figure paragraph (Figures 1\u201312), explicitly state which trace corresponds to control and which to drug in Figure~\\ref{...}, and describe any divergence in shape, timing, or magnitude between the two traces as a function of time or beat index.\r\n- When discussing Figure 11 and Figure 12, interpret the differences in iNet and qNet between control and drug in the context of TdP risk, explaining whether the drug-induced changes in net current or qNet are consistent with increased or decreased proarrhythmic liability.\r\n\r\nFIGURE LABEL CONSISTENCY:\r\n- Use only the figure labels defined in the LaTeX file supplied in the prompt. Do not invent new labels or change their spelling. When referencing a figure, always use the exact label name given (for example, Figure~\\ref{fig:time-series-vm} or Figure~\\ref{fig:features-ca-max}), and do not attempt to infer or modify labels from the figure number alone.\r\n- If the prompt provides a mapping from figure numbers (1\u201312) to specific LaTeX labels, always use those labels verbatim when constructing Figure~\\ref{...} references for the corresponding paragraphs.\r\n\r\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\r\n- Return only valid LaTeX content (no Markdown, no explanations)."
