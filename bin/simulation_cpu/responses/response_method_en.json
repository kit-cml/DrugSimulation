The CiPAORdv1.0 endo model, an optimized variant of the O'Hara-Rudy dynamic (ORd) model incorporating a Markov-state representation of dynamic drug interactions with the rapid delayed rectifier potassium current (\\(I_{\\text{Kr}}\\)), was employed to predict Torsade de Pointes (TdP) liability.[1][8][9] Multi-channel ionic current inhibition was derived from drug concentration-response experiments, including Hill equation-based IC50 data for quinidine from \\nolinkurl{chantest_hill/quinidine/IC50_samples30.csv} and hERG-specific parameters from \\nolinkurl{chantest_herg/quinidine/boot_pars30.csv}, with conductance variability activated via \\nolinkurl{./population/indi_1sample.csv}.[9]\n\nA key electrophysiological biomarker computed was qNet, defined as the net electronic charge carried by the major ionic currents during one cardiac action potential. This quantity is given by\n\\[\nq_{\\text{Net}} = \\int_{0}^{T} \\left( I_{\\text{Na}} + I_{\\text{CaL}} + I_{\\text{Kr}} + I_{\\text{Ks}} + I_{\\text{to}} + I_{\\text{K1}} \\right) \\, dt\n\\]\nwhere \\(T\\) is the duration of one cardiac cycle, and \\(I_{\\text{Na}}\\), \\(I_{\\text{CaL}}\\), \\(I_{\\text{Kr}}\\), \\(I_{\\text{Ks}}\\), \\(I_{\\text{to}}\\), and \\(I_{\\text{K1}}\\) represent the sodium, L-type calcium, rapid and slow delayed-rectifier potassium, transient outward potassium, and inward rectifier potassium currents, respectively.[1]\n\nLower qNet values tend to associate with reduced repolarization reserve and higher proarrhythmic potential, as they reflect an imbalance favoring inward currents that prolong action potential duration and promote early afterdepolarizations (EADs).[1][2] qNet is one of the core quantitative endpoints endorsed by CiPA modeling working groups, providing enhanced predictive power through incorporation of \\(I_{\\text{Kr}}\\)-drug binding dynamics and accurate representation of multi-channel block effects.[1]\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Simulations used the CVode solver with minimum and maximum time steps of 0.5 msec and 2.0 msec, respectively, a writing step of 1.0 msec, and a stimulus duration of 0.5 msec at amplitude scale 1.0.\n\\item Pacing protocol applied 1000 cycles at a cycle length of 2000 msec, with the final 10 paces analyzed after reaching steady state.\n\\item Quinidine was simulated at concentrations of 3237, 6474, and 9711 nM, corresponding to therapeutic and supratherapeutic levels.\n\\item Parallel computation utilized 10 CPUs via MPI for efficient processing of population variability samples.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nAll simulations and qNet computations were performed using rigorously validated numerical solvers and verified parameter consistency under CiPA reference conditions.[1][8][9]\n```"},"delta":{"role":"assistant","content":""},"finish_reason":"stop"}]}
