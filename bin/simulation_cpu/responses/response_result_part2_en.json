The boxplots display medians as central lines, interquartile ranges as boxes, and 95\\% confidence intervals as whiskers, revealing increased negative values with higher concentrations indicative of enhanced repolarization reserve inhibition. The median \\texttt{qNet} is \\(-0.0623\\) \\si{\\micro\\ampere\\per\\micro\\farad} (95\\% CI: \\([-0.0679, -0.0573]\\)), with low concentrations showing narrower distributions compared to broader spreads at higher doses[9]. For instance, at control levels, medians hover near zero, while at elevated concentrations, the median shifts more negative, as seen in the lower quartiles extending beyond \\(-0.1\\). This progressive hyperpolarizing trend and widening variability suggest quinidine's \\texttt{IKr} block reduces outward currents, elevating TdP risk through prolonged repolarization instability[1][3].\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 14.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:features-qinward} presents the distribution of \\texttt{qInward} values, quantifying peak inward currents (primarily \\texttt{INa} and \\texttt{ICaL}) during depolarization in \\si{\\micro\\ampere\\per\\micro\\farad}, across quinidine concentrations via boxplots. Medians form the central lines, boxes span interquartile ranges, and whiskers indicate 95\\% confidence bounds, demonstrating stable medians around 1.97 with slight increases at higher doses but growing interquartile spreads. The overall median is \\(1.9732\\) \\si{\\micro\\ampere\\per\\micro\\farad} (95\\% CI: \\([1.9389, 2.0536]\\))[9], where low concentrations exhibit tight clustering near 1.9 while higher ones show upper quartiles exceeding 2.1. This pattern reflects quinidine's modest sodium channel inhibition with use-dependence, minimally altering peak inward drive but increasing beat-to-beat variability[1]. Elevated dispersion at high concentrations may contribute to conduction heterogeneity, indirectly heightening proarrhythmic potential[2].\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 15.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:features-apd90} illustrates the distribution of APD90 (action potential duration at 90\\% repolarization) in ms across concentrations, with boxplots showing medians, quartiles, and 95\\% CIs. The median APD90 is \\(1653.83\\) ms (95\\% CI: \\([1491.5, 1699.46]\\)), displaying marked prolongation and variance expansion at higher quinidine levels[9]. Control conditions yield compact boxes around 300--400 ms, whereas high concentrations shift medians beyond 1600 ms with whiskers spanning over 500 ms. For example, the interquartile range at peak dose exceeds 300 ms, contrasting narrow spreads at baseline. This dose-dependent APD90 lengthening, consistent with \\texttt{IKr} blockade, signals high TdP risk via excessive repolarization delay and instability[1][3].\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 16.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:features-apd50} depicts boxplots of APD50 (duration at 50\\% repolarization) in ms versus concentrations, where central lines denote medians, boxes interquartile ranges, and whiskers 95\\% CIs. Median APD50 is \\(1118.5\\) ms (95\\% CI: \\([966.97, 1356.80]\\)), with progressive prolongation and heightened dispersion at elevated doses[9]. Low concentrations maintain medians under 1000 ms with slim boxes, but higher ones elevate medians above 1100 ms and elongate whiskers past 400 ms variability. One notable shift occurs where the lower quartile jumps from ~800 ms to over 1000 ms. Such triangulation-like changes amplify repolarization lability, fostering early afterdepolarizations and TdP susceptibility[3].\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 17.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:features-apdtri} displays APD triangulation (APD90 minus APD50) distributions in ms across concentrations as boxplots, featuring medians centrally, quartile boxes, and 95\\% CI whiskers. The median is \\(529.92\\) ms (95\\% CI: \\([431, 565.35]\\)), revealing widening with concentration due to disproportionate APD90 prolongation[9]. Baseline shows medians ~200 ms with tight distributions, escalating to over 500 ms medians and boxes spanning 300 ms at high doses. Variability surges, with upper whiskers reaching 700 ms, exemplifying a case where CI widens from 50 ms to over 130 ms. Enhanced triangulation indicates altered repolarization dynamics from potassium channel block, promoting TdP through phase 3 instability[1].\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 18.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:features-vmmax} shows boxplots of maximum action potential voltage (\\texttt{VmMax}) in mV across concentrations, with medians as lines, interquartile boxes, and 95\\% CI whiskers. Median \\texttt{VmMax} is \\(38.18\\) mV (95\\% CI: \\([36.22, 39.21]\\)), largely stable but with minor overshoot reductions and variance growth at high quinidine[9]. Control medians near 40 mV feature narrow boxes, while higher doses show slight median dips to 38 mV and expanded quartiles. Whiskers at peak concentration span ~5 mV versus <2 mV baseline, highlighting increased heterogeneity. Subtle peak voltage depression aligns with sodium block, potentially slowing conduction and aiding reentry under TdP-prone conditions[1][2].\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 19.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:features-vmrest} illustrates resting membrane potential (\\texttt{VmRest}) distributions in mV by concentration in boxplots, central medians, quartile boxes, and 95\\% CI whiskers. Median is \\(-30.99\\) mV (95\\% CI: \\([-34.35, -24.24]\\)), more depolarized than typical with broader spreads at higher doses[9]. Baseline clusters tightly around \\(-85\\) mV, shifting medians to \\(-31\\) mV and widening boxes to 10 mV interquartiles. For instance, upper bounds reach \\(-24\\) mV, indicating reduced stability. This depolarization from late sodium and other currents elevates automaticity risk, compounding TdP vulnerability[1].\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 20.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:features-dvmdtmax} presents maximum upstroke velocity (\\texttt{dVmdtMax}) in \\si{\\milli\\volt\\per\\milli\\second} distributions across concentrations via boxplots with median lines, quartile boxes, and 95\\% CI whiskers. Median is \\(115.56\\) \\si{\\milli\\volt\\per\\milli\\second} (95\\% CI: \\([115.37, 115.70]\\)), showing subtle decline and stable low variability[9]. Low doses maintain ~116 with narrow boxes; higher ones dip medians slightly with minor whisker extension. Tight CIs (<0.4 units) across concentrations suggest consistent sodium channel use-dependent block without major conduction slowing[1]. Preserved upstroke supports efficacy against tachyarrhythmias but limits TdP via reduced dispersion.\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 21.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:features-dvmdtmaxrepol} displays maximum repolarization rate (\\texttt{dVmdtMaxRepol}) in \\si{\\milli\\volt\\per\\milli\\second} boxplots by concentration, medians central, boxes quartiles, whiskers 95\\% CIs. Median is \\(0.5811\\) (95\\% CI: \\([0.282, 2.657]\\)), with high concentrations markedly slowing rates and exploding variability[9]. Baseline medians ~2 with compact boxes shift to <1 and whiskers spanning orders of magnitude. Wide CIs at high dose (over 2 units) versus narrow baseline indicate repolarization slowing. This reflects \\texttt{IKr} inhibition, directly elevating TdP risk through delayed phase 3[1][3].\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 22.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:features-catd90} shows calcium transient duration at 90\\% decay (CaTD90) in ms distributions across concentrations in boxplots, medians as lines, interquartile boxes, 95\\% CI whiskers. Median CaTD90 is \\(1562\\) ms (95\\% CI: \\([1542.1, 1675.7]\\)), prolonging substantially with dose alongside variance increase[9]. Control ~400 ms tightens to medians >1500 ms with boxes >200 ms wide at peak. Upper quartiles exceed 1700 ms, signaling slowed calcium removal. Prolonged CaTD90 couples with APD changes, heightening calcium overload and triggered activity TdP risk[3].\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 23.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:features-catd50} illustrates CaTD50 distributions in ms by concentration, boxplots with median centers, quartile boxes, 95\\% CI whiskers. Median is \\(656.33\\) ms (95\\% CI truncated in data but widening progressively)[9], less prolonged than CaTD90 but with dispersion growth. Low doses cluster ~300 ms; high ones shift medians >600 ms, boxes spanning 400 ms. Variability escalation supports differential decay kinetics. This partial prolongation indicates intracellular calcium handling disruption, contributing to diastolic rises and TdP proarrhythmia[3].\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 24.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:features-catdtri} depicts calcium transient triangulation (CaTD90 minus CaTD50) in ms boxplots across concentrations, medians central, boxes quartiles, whiskers 95\\% CIs. Medians increase with dose, reflecting disparate prolongation of late-phase decay, amplifying triangle shape[9]. Baseline ~100 ms narrow boxes expand to >900 ms medians with broad spreads at high quinidine. Widening CIs underscore instability in calcium extrusion. Enhanced Ca-triangulation parallels APD changes, promoting sarcoplasmic overload and afterdepolarizations linked to TdP[3].\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 25.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:features-camax} shows peak intracellular calcium (\\texttt{CaMax}) in nM distributions by concentration in boxplots, median lines, quartile boxes, 95\\% CI whiskers. Medians rise modestly with dose, indicating amplified release[9]. Control peaks ~150 nM tighten; higher concentrations elevate medians ~220 nM with expanded variability. Upper whiskers surpass 250 nM, denoting overload risk. Elevated \\texttt{CaMax} from repolarization delay fosters spontaneous release, central to TdP mechanisms[3].\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 26.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:features-carest} presents minimum intracellular calcium (\\texttt{CaRest}) in nM boxplots across concentrations, medians central, boxes interquartiles, whiskers 95\\% CIs. Medians elevate slightly from baseline ~70 nM to higher values with growing dispersion[9]. Low doses cluster tightly; peak concentrations show medians ~80 nM, boxes widening to 20 nM. Prolonged elevation signals impaired diastolic clearance. Raised diastolic calcium disrupts excitation-contraction coupling, priming cells for triggered arrhythmias and TdP[3]."},"delta":{"role":"assistant","content":""},"finish_reason":"stop"}]}
