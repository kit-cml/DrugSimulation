In control simulations (Figure 1), action potentials exhibited standard morphology with rapid upstroke, plateau phase, and repolarization, accompanied by balanced net currents and calcium transients of typical duration. As quinidine concentration increased, time-series traces (Figures 1-13) showed progressive prolongation of repolarization phases, evidenced by slower decay in membrane potential and elevated plateau potentials, primarily driven by block of the rapid delayed rectifier current IKr alongside contributions from sodium current INa and late sodium current INaL block. Ionic current traces indicated reduced IKr magnitude and altered INaL integrals, with increased late-phase inward currents at higher concentrations leading to enhanced qNet values (median shifting from near zero in control to more positive at high doses), consistent with reduced repolarization reserve. Calcium handling displayed prolonged transient durations, with slower decay kinetics reflecting interplay between L-type calcium current ICaL block and intracellular dynamics, as seen in elevated Cai peaks and extended time above threshold in representative beats.\n\nFeature-level summary statistics, derived from median values and 95\\% confidence intervals across multiple beats and samples (Figure 13), reinforced these trends while quantifying population-level variability critical for TdP risk classification. qNet distributions shifted positively with concentration, with medians increasing alongside widening confidence intervals indicating heterogeneous responses, while qInward medians rose substantially (e.g., to approximately 1.97 normalized units at high exposure), highlighting enhanced net inward charge as a key proarrhythmic marker per CiPA guidelines. Action potential duration at 90\\% repolarization (APD90) medians extended markedly from control (around 300 milliseconds) to over 1600 milliseconds at high concentrations, with APD50 and triangulation (APDTri median around 530 milliseconds) showing similar prolongation and increased dispersion, suggestive of early afterdepolarizations and repolarization instability. Calcium transient durations (CaTD90 median around 1560 milliseconds, CaTD50 around 656 milliseconds) and associated triangulation exhibited comparable extensions, linking ionic perturbations to excitation-contraction coupling disruptions. These aggregated distributions nuanced single-beat observations by revealing confidence interval expansions at intermediate concentrations, implying stochastic variability in channel block that could precipitate arrhythmias, and aligned with mechanistic hypotheses where IKr inhibition dominates low-to-moderate doses but multi-channel effects amplify TdP risk at higher exposures by depleting repolarization reserve and promoting calcium overload.\n\nThe concentration-dependent patterns observed support quinidine's classification as an intermediate-to-high TdP risk compound within CiPA paradigms, with time-series morphologies and feature summaries demonstrating consistent QT prolongation and re-entry vulnerability akin to clinical observations. Discrepancies, such as less pronounced resting potential depolarization (VmRest median around -31 millivolts) than expected from pure INa block, suggest state-dependent kinetics tempering effects, while broad confidence intervals underscore the need for population-based simulations to capture proarrhythmic liability beyond deterministic models. These findings validate the framework's utility for dissecting drug actions, emphasizing qNet and qInward as robust classifiers alongside APD and CaTD metrics, and highlight implications for safer ion channel pharmacology by quantifying risk gradients across therapeutic ranges."},"delta":{"role":"assistant","content":""},"finish_reason":"stop"}]}
