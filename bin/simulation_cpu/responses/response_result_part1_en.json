In control simulations, the action potential reached a peak membrane potential of approximately 38~mV with a maximum upstroke velocity of 115~\\(\\mu\\)V/ms, while under high quinidine, the peak was reduced to 16~mV and upstroke slowed to -0.16~mV/ms. Action potential duration at 90\\% repolarization (APD90) was markedly prolonged from a median of 280~ms in control to 1654~ms under drug, accompanied by increased beat-to-beat variability and triangulation. Intracellular calcium transients showed elevated peak levels from 74~nM to 206~nM, with prolonged durations (CaTD90 from 1200~ms to 1562~ms). Net charge (qNet) shifted from near balance to a median of -0.062~\\(\\mu\\)C/\\(\\mu\\)F, indicating enhanced repolarization reserve disruption.\n\nQuinidine at high concentration induced prominent reductions in fast sodium current (INa) peak from -53~nA/\\(\\mu\\)F to near zero and late sodium current (INaL) from -0.32 to -0.019~nA/\\(\\mu\\)F, consistent with class Ia block. L-type calcium current (ICaL) exhibited greater peak inward magnitude (-297 vs -0.0002~nA/\\(\\mu\\)F), prolonging plateau phase. Repolarizing currents showed complex changes: hERG (IKr) increased dramatically to peaks over 120~nA/\\(\\mu\\)F early in repolarization, while slow delayed rectifier (IKs) rose from -0.002 to 81~nA/\\(\\mu\\)F, inward rectifier (IK1) from -9 to 1~\\(\\mu\\)A/\\(\\mu\\)F, and transient outward (Ito) from -0.0006 to 0.25~nA/\\(\\mu\\)F. These alterations culminated in net inward current (iNet) imbalances and qNet accumulation, signaling elevated torsades de pointes (TdP) risk through early afterdepolarizations.\n\nOverall, high-dose quinidine profoundly disrupted excitability and repolarization, with APD prolongation exceeding 500\\% and charge imbalances suggestive of proarrhythmic liability, though no overt arrhythmias were captured in the 10-beat traces.\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 1.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:time-series-vm} displays membrane potential (\\(V_m\\)) over time for control (black trace) and highest quinidine concentration (red trace). The x-axis represents time in ms from 0 to 2000~ms, and the y-axis shows \\(V_m\\) in mV ranging from -90 to 50~mV. In control, \\(V_m\\) exhibits stable action potentials with resting potential near -88~mV, peak at 38~mV around 13~ms, and repolarization by 300~ms; under drug, resting is similar at -88~mV at t=0, but peaks only reach 16~mV at t=0~ms (delayed onset), with dramatically prolonged repolarization beyond 1800~ms. For example, at t=300~ms, control \\(V_m\\) has returned to -74~mV while drug remains at -25~mV. This prolongation reflects quinidine's multichannel block, increasing TdP risk by fostering early afterdepolarizations.\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 2.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:time-series-dvmdt} shows the rate of change of membrane potential (dV/dt) over time for control (black) and high-dose quinidine (red) traces. The x-axis is time in ms (0--2000), y-axis dV/dt in mV/ms (-1 to 20). Control displays sharp upstroke peaks of 19~mV/ms at ~11~ms and repolarization rates ~ -1~mV/ms; drug trace shows blunted upstroke at -0.16~mV/ms near t=0, with slower repolarization rates around -0.001~mV/ms persisting past 1000~ms. At t=11~ms, control dV/dt is 18.9~mV/ms versus drug's near-zero. The reduced upstroke velocity under quinidine indicates sodium channel inhibition, compromising conduction and contributing to arrhythmogenic substrate for TdP.\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 3.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:time-series-cai} plots intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca\\(^{2+}\\)]_i) over time, with control (black) and quinidine (red) overlays. Axes: time (ms, 0--2000), [Ca\\(^{2+}\\)]_i (nM, 70--220). Control starts at 74.5~nM, peaks subtly during AP; drug elevates to 206~nM at t=0~ms, declining slowly to 74~nM by 2000~ms with less decay. For instance, at t=100~ms, control is ~75~nM while drug remains ~100~nM. Prolonged calcium elevation under quinidine suggests ICaL enhancement and impaired extrusion, promoting triggered activity and heightened TdP susceptibility.\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 4.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:time-series-inal} depicts late sodium current (INaL) time courses for control (black) and high quinidine (red). Time (ms, 0--2000) on x-axis, current (nA/\\(\\mu\\)F, -500 to 0) on y-axis. Control INaL is steady at ~-0.32~nA/\\(\\mu\\)F; drug sharply reduces to -0.019~nA/\\(\\mu\\)F at t=0, remaining minimal. At t=12~ms, control ~-478~nA/\\(\\mu\\)F versus drug -0.019~nA/\\(\\mu\\)F. Quinidine's block of INaL diminishes persistent inward current, paradoxically aiding repolarization late but exacerbating early plateau prolongation linked to TdP.\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 5.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:time-series-ina} illustrates fast sodium current (INa) for control (black) and drug (red) conditions. X-axis time (ms), y-axis INa (nA/\\(\\mu\\)F, -60 to 0). Control shows transient peak of -53~nA/\\(\\mu\\)F at t=11~ms; drug abolishes this, staying near 0~nA/\\(\\mu\\)F throughout. Specifically, control at t=11~ms reaches -53.2 versus drug 0. The near-complete INa suppression by quinidine slows conduction velocity, creating heterogeneous repolarization gradients that elevate TdP risk in the model.\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 6.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:time-series-ical} presents L-type calcium current (ICaL) over time, control black, quinidine red. Axes: time (ms, 0--2000), ICaL (nA/\\(\\mu\\)F, -300 to 0). Control near-zero; drug peaks at -297~nA/\\(\\mu\\)F at t=0, decaying slowly. At t=1~ms, drug -295 versus control -0.0002~nA/\\(\\mu\\)F. Enhanced ICaL under quinidine prolongs the plateau phase, a hallmark of TdP-prolonging drugs by increasing inward current during repolarization.\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 7.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:time-series-iks} shows slow delayed rectifier potassium current (IKs), control (black) versus drug (red). Time (ms), current (nA/\\(\\mu\\)F, 0--100). Control minimal at -0.002~nA/\\(\\mu\\)F; drug activates to 81~nA/\\(\\mu\\)F at t=0, rising further. Example: t=0~ms drug 80.7 versus control -0.002. Augmented IKs compensates somewhat for repolarization delay but fails to prevent overall prolongation, consistent with quinidine's complex multichannel effects on TdP liability.\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 8.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:time-series-ik1} displays inward rectifier potassium current (IK1), black control, red quinidine. X: time (ms), y: IK1 (\\(\\mu\\)A/\\(\\mu\\)F, -9 to 2). Control steady ~-9~\\(\\mu\\)A/\\(\\mu\\)F; drug shifts positive to 1.3~\\(\\mu\\)A/\\(\\mu\\)F early, stabilizing low. At t=0, control -8.98 versus drug 1.27~\\(\\mu\\)A/\\(\\mu\\)F. Reduced IK1 rectification under quinidine impairs late repolarization stability, promoting proarrhythmic pauses and TdP initiation.\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 9.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:time-series-ito} plots transient outward current (Ito) time series, control black, drug red. Time (ms), Ito (nA/\\(\\mu\\)F, 0--1). Control negligible -0.0006~nA/\\(\\mu\\)F; drug peaks at 0.25~nA/\\(\\mu\\)F at t=0. For example, t=0~ms drug 0.25 versus control -0.0006. Mild Ito increase aids early repolarization but is overwhelmed by inward currents, contributing to net prolongation and TdP risk in the simulation.\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 10.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:time-series-ikr} illustrates hERG current (IKr) for control (black) and quinidine (red). Axes: time (ms, 0--2000), IKr (nA/\\(\\mu\\)F, 0--130). Control small -0.0002~nA/\\(\\mu\\)F; drug surges to 120~nA/\\(\\mu\\)F at t=0, peaking higher. At t=15~ms, drug 146 versus control 0.0005. Paradoxical IKr enhancement despite hERG block context suggests indirect effects, aiding repolarization but insufficient against dominant inward shifts elevating TdP potential.\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 11.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:time-series-inet} shows net inward and outward current (iNet), control black, quinidine red. Time (ms), iNet (\\(\\mu\\)A/\\(\\mu\\)F, -2 to 0.2). Control balances near zero with transients; drug shows early inward peaks -1.7~\\(\\mu\\)A/\\(\\mu\\)F at t=12~ms, prolonged negative phase. Example: t=12~ms drug -1.69 versus control -0.25~\\(\\mu\\)A/\\(\\mu\\)F. Persistent net inward iNet under quinidine delays repolarization, a classic TdP risk marker via afterdepolarization facilitation.\n\n\\paragraph{Figure 12.}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:time-series-inet-auc} depicts AUC of net current (qNet) over time, control (black) and drug (red). X: time (ms, 0--2000), y: qNet (\\(\\mu\\)C/\\(\\mu\\)F, -50 to 0). Control oscillates mildly around zero; drug accumulates negative charge to -47~\\(\\mu\\)C/\\(\\mu\\)F by late times. At t=200~ms, drug -26 versus control -0.4~\\(\\mu\\)C/\\(\\mu\\)F. Progressive qNet negativity indicates unresolved inward current imbalance, strongly consistent with increased proarrhythmic liability and TdP risk in this model."},"delta":{"role":"assistant","content":""},"finish_reason":"stop"}]}
